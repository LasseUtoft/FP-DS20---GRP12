Trump's @EPA  is propping up a dying industry that has put our health at risk for decades, & fueled the #ClimateCrisis, by giving them a free pass to continue to dump deadly pollution into our water.

@sarahcpr Trump on all these issues - #ClimateChange, Covid, tax cuts for wealthy, water & air quality etc- falls back on the argument that ""there are people who disagree with the experts"".

We have a short window to act on the #climatecrisis and avoid the widespread economic, environmental and human damage #climatechange would bring.  There is no time to wait. There is no planet B. The world wants action on #climatechange. Time to deliver.  #ActOnClimate @JoeBiden

 it‚Äôs not incredible that Morrison is favouring #Trump. Neither man cares a jot about #climatechange - nor will act in the interests of planetary survival. Both disdain the vulnerable. Both crave power. #Trump infinitely more dangerous, but supporting him endangers us all.

We've got 8 years left because of #ClimateChange according to the DoofusRats like @ewarren?  I'd rather spend it with 2 more terms of Trump & call it a wrap, than have left-wing cultists force conversion to their phony religion.

0.2% Australians employed fossil fuel industry 82% now believe in climatechange. @ScottMorrisonMP states he won't let the UK, Brussels or ""any other country"" dictate terms. No mention of United States, so ScottMorrisonMP's balls still very much in Trump's rapture-vice.
